# nanoRat

This is first prototype and acts as a base to make a RAT according to your need

This is fully functional so you can use it to copy code snippets

Some classes are deprecated and code is like sh*t no comments or structure but we are working on it

And trying to make code more readable, orgnised, upto date and add more functionality

more update and webserver code will be available soon!
